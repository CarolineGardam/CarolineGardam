ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CarolineGardam

I'm not a developer; I'm a communications researcher.
I'm mucking around with code to better understand this side of the screen.

My research involves mis/dis/mal-information (whatever that may be), particularly about climate change, on social media.

I also work as co-producer for an arts online broadcast.

Back in the old days, I was a writer and editor. I'm still that, but now I produce content.
